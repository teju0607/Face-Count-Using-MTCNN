# Face-Count-Using-MTCNN
Excited to share our project "Face Count Using MTCNN", where we explore real-time face detection and counting using the powerful Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN)!

Our system captures live video input and uses MTCNN to detect and count faces with high accuracyâ€”even in varied lighting and crowded scenes. This solution has great potential in:

Attendance systems

Crowd management

Smart surveillance

Queue monitoring in retail

Looking forward to applying this further in real-world scenarios and smart analytics!
